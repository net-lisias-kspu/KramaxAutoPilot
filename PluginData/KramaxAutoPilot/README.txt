Kramax AutoPilot User Flight Plans

This is where you put your Custom Flight Plans. Each file will be read
in Alphabetical Order (ignoring case, and ordering numbers as a
human would do: "1, 2, 11").

This is also where your "_FlightPlans.cfg" file will be persisted. 
Please note that all plans from all your custom files will be merged 
to this file, as well any runtime plan you create.

The "_FlightPlans.cfg" file will be overwritten every time, but none of
the others.
